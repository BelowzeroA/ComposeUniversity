Patriot is one who loves and serves his own country as a loyal citizen. He is called a true patriot who loves his coun­try and is ready to sacrifice his all for her cause, and whole­heartedly works for the welfare of his motherland.

The land, on which one is born and brought up and lives, is naturally dear to him than any other land. This love for his birthplace grows into patriotism.

If his motherland is attacked by the enemies, he does not hesitate to fight for the protection of freedom of his native land. He can do any thing to glorify his country. He feels proud of his country. This patriotic feeling can be found in many great heroes in history.

In India, we know many patriots who suffered inhuman distress at the hands of the foreign rulers, because they loved their country, and wanted to make her free from the shackles of the foreign rule.

They were imprisoned, publicly flogged and had undergone inhuman torture for their undying patrio­tism. Still they did not step down, even at the cost of their life. They carried on their struggle for freedom for many years. This is true patriotism.

A true patriot will go to the war with a smiling face to sacrifice his life, if needed. He will serve the poor and the distressed people of his country out of compassion that arises from patriotism. He will devote himself to the work of development of his own people.

He does not bother about his personal interests or gains, when he goes forward with his spirit of patriotism. A true patriot is worshipped by his countrymen. They shed tears when he dies, as if, he was one of their nearest relations.
