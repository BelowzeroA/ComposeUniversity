Patriotism is the zealous love for one’s country.  It’s like a disease that every man carries.  It spreads from one soul to the next like an unstoppable wildfire.  There is no cure for such a disease; for this is one of pure determination and pride.

            The definition of patriotism cannot be defined by a dictionary, but by people.  From America’s Founding Fathers to today’s courageous men and women of our military serving in Afghanistan, this disease known as patriotism fills our hearts with the will to protect freedom.  Patriotism is what gave George Washington the courage to fight the super power of the world and take charge of an unstable colony.  Patriotism gave him courage.

            Patriotism is why America leads the world.  Men and women have a deep will to work and succeed.  This disease is why Neil Armstrong stepped onto uncertain ground.  He wanted to show the world that his nation had accomplished something no other had.  He took the leap onto the moon to prove his patriotism.

            In the Second World War, there was a shortage of workers needed to fulfill the cry for war supplies.  Millions of women stepped up to show their love and determination for their country.  They worked to fulfill a call that men could not due to war.  Patriotism filled their hearts and gave them the bravery to do what was then a man’s work.

            Patriotism is in all our hearts.  We may not always know it until the call comes upon us.  Patriotism may be a disease, but it is one no man should have any intention of curing.  It brings out compassion, courage, work ethics, and bravery in us all.
