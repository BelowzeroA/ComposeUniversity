The feeling of Patriotism is important for the Freedom of a Country. A partiotic person will always be ready to sacrifice his life for the love for his country. A Patriot is immortal.

Men love their own country. They do many things for the good of the country. This feeling for their country is called patriotism.

Patriotism is one of the best virtues of men. It is a noble feeling of the mind. It is said that mother and motherland are superior to heaven. Most men have got a love for their country. They wish to make their native land free. Some are ready to sacrifice their own interest for the good of the country. A selfish man cannot love his native country. A selfish man may be rich; he may he born a noble family; he may have a big title, but nobody respects him. After his death, he is forgotten by all. He is sometimes an enemy to the country. He seeks his own interest. He can even do harm to the country for his own interest. But everybody, praises a patriot. A patriot is immortal. He is worshiped by his countrymen. He is honored all over the world.

Every one of us knows the name of Maharana Rana Pratap Singh of Mewar. He was a king. But he suffered great hardship for his country. He sacrificed everything for the freedom of his country. He was a great patriot. He earned an immortal name by his self-sacrifice. Thus many patriots lost their all, even their lives for the good of the country. But they gained one thing. They won the hearts of their countrymen.

We must love our country; at the same time we must not hate others. Wars break out between two nations for want of love for other countries. We should, therefore, love our country as well as those of others.
