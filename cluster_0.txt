just
as
we
love
our
father
and
mother
so
we
love
land
of
our
birth
similarly
some
people
love
their
country
less
and
love
themselves
more
healthy
patriotism
teaches
us
to
love
out
county
with
all
our
heart
and
to
do
everything
in
our
power
to
make
our
country
happy
great
and
glorious
it
is
our
duty
to
love
the
land
of
our
birth
we
must
try
to
cultivate
a
healthy
type
of
patriotism
and
to
devote
ourselves
whole
heartedly
to
the
uplift
and
prosperity
of
our
own
country
a
partiotic
person
will
always
be
ready
to
sacrifice
his
life
for
the
love
for
his
country
men
love
their
own
country
they
do
many
things
for
the
good
of
the
country
most
men
have
got
a
love
for
their
country
some
are
ready
to
sacrifice
their
own
interest
for
the
good
of
the
country
thus
many
patriots
lost
their
all
even
their
lives
for
the
good
of
the
country
they
won
the
hearts
of
their
countrymen
we
must
love
our
country
at
the
same
time
we
must
not
hate
others
wars
break
out
between
two
nations
for
want
of
love
for
other
countries
we
should
therefore
love
our
country
as
well
as
those
of
others
from
americas
founding
fathers
to
todays
courageous
men
and
women
of
our
military
serving
in
afghanistan
this
disease
known
as
patriotism
fills
our
hearts
with
the
will
to
protect
freedom
men
and
women
have
a
deep
will
to
work
and
succeed
millions
of
women
stepped
up
to
show
their
love
and
determination
for
their
country
they
worked
to
fulfill
a
call
that
men
could
not
due
to
war
patriotism
filled
their
hearts
and
gave
them
the
bravery
to
do
what
was
then
a
mans
work
patriotism
means
intense
love
for
ones
motherland
but
there
are
people
who
pretend
to
be
patriot
but
do
anything
for
their
own
interest
even
at
the
cost
of
their
native
country
all
great
nations
which
made
their
name
in
history
are
proud
to
illustrate
the
services
of
their
patriots
these
patriots
have
made
great
sacrifices
for
their
motherland
come
in
this
category
whose
infidelity
brought
great
distress
to
our
country
patriotism
to
me
along
with
many
others
means
of
course
to
have
love
for
our
homeland
our
country
to
support
serve
and
defend
to
be
inspired
by
to
change
for
the
better
and
to
care
deeply
for
fellow
americans
after
september
11th
a
lot
of
people
showed
their
love
for
this
country
by
doing
things
like
standing
in
line
to
donate
blood
registering
with
the
army
or
even
as
little
as
wearing
the
american
colors
i
believe
that
true
patriotism
doesnt
have
to
be
encouraged
but
is
something
that
we
feel
24
hours
a
day
seven
days
a
week
all
year
long
he
can
do
any
thing
to
glorify
his
country
this
patriotic
feeling
can
be
found
in
many
great
heroes
in
history
in
india
we
know
many
patriots
who
suffered
inhuman
distress
at
the
hands
of
the
foreign
rulers
because
they
loved
their
country
and
wanted
to
make
her
free
from
the
shackles
of
the
foreign
rule
patriotism
means
a
profound
love
of
people
to
the
nationality
they
contribute
to
mutual
understanding
peace
and
unity
of
the
nation
patriotism
means
love
and
regard
for
the
country
we
love
pakistan
because
it
is
the
centre
of
our
hopes
and
future
dreams
pakistan
can
become
a
really
strong
country
when
the
people
of
pakistan
are
patriots
in
the
real
sense
of
the
world
give
you
love
to
your
country
and
it
will
give
you
all
the
blessings
it
means
laying
down
your
life
for
those
you
love
and
for
those
you
do
not
know
i
never
knew
the
true
meaning
of
patriotism
until
my
cousin
and
my
family
friend
sacrificed
their
lives
defending
our
country
my
cousin
cpl
john
felix
farias
also
lost
his
life
in
afghanistan
fighting
the
war
on
terror
at
the
funeral
of
john
felix
i
saw
patriotism
when
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
lined
the
streets
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
his
motorcade
thinking
of
all
these
things
makes
me
respect
the
moment
of
silence
at
school
the
national
anthem
before
my
softball
games
and
any
time
i
hear
the
pledge
of
allegiance
i
have
uncles
cousins
grandfathers
and
friends
who
served
this
country
as
marines
navy
seals
army
and
air
force
and
that
makes
me
proud
to
me
patriotism
means
to
love
and
respect
your
country
the
flag
and
our
leaders
to
me
it
also
means
loving
that
we
come
together
to
celebrate
for
of
4th
of
july
and
memorial
day
like
i
said
some
people
do
not
know
the
true
meaning
of
patriotism
but
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
know
what
patriotism
is
remember
to
respect
and
always
love
your
country
