Family is very important for everyone. Our parents, grandparents, our brothers and sisters surround us from the first days of our lives. They influence us in many aspects: character, interests, habits, behavior.

My name is Sam and I would like to tell you about my family. But to begin with – a few words about myself. I am a schoolboy, twelve years old. I don’t like school very much, but I am a good pupil, because I read a lot of books.

I have got mother, father and elder brother. My mother is thirty-nine years old. She is a musician, she plays the piano. Her job is a music teacher and she gives concerts one or two times a month. Her favorite genres are classical music and jazz. Mom also likes to paint in her free time, it is her hobby.

My father is forty-two years old. He is a fitness instructor and he works in a gym. He is fit and healthy. He has no hobbies, usually he spends evenings in front of the computer. He likes watching videos on YouTube.

My brother is nineteen years oldand he is a student. He studies information technologies, but his hobby is tattoo making. He learned drawing when he was a child, so his works are quite good. He even won a prize at a regional tattoo contest. He has a pretty girlfriend and they often spend time together at our home. She is nice.

So, as you see, members of our family are very different. Mom is an artist, Dad is a “simple guy” as he calls himself, brother is a smart student with an unusual hobby. I am a quiet boy, I enjoy reading books. I prefer do it in the library, because it is usually rather noisy at home. There are too many people in three rooms. Sometimes we quarrel about something, but it is never serious. I love my family very much and they love me too.
