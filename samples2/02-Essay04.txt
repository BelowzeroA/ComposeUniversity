I am Ildar Kirillov. Ildar is my first name and Kirillov is my last name. I am sixteen years old. I want to tell you something about my family. It is not big family - only five people. I have a father, mother, sister, and grandmother.

First of all, a few words about my parents. My father is forty five. He is an engineer. He likes singing and when we have free time at home I play the guitar and we sing together. When my father was a little boy he used to take things into pieces. My grandmother told me a story that once he tried to mend their microwave oven but he could not. Then they had to call in a repairman. It happened a long time ago but now he is able to fix almost everything.

My mother is a good-looking lady with dark hair. She is forty two but she looks much younger. She is a geography teacher and she works at school. She likes her job. My mother keeps house tidy and takes care of everyone of us. Also, she is very good at cooking.

My parents have been married for 18 years. They usually work hard. They have a lot in common but they have different views on music, books, and movies. For example, my father likes horror films whereas my mother likes comedies; my father is fond of football but my mother doesn’t like any sports.

My grandmother is retired. She lives with us and helps us to run the house. My sister's name is Alice. She is younger than me and she's a schoolgirl. I like playing with her on the backyard.

I want to go to university because I would like to study foreign languages. I always try to be in a good mood. We are a good family and we have a lot of relatives.
