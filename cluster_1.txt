just
as
it
is
the
first
duty
of
a
child
to
love
his
home
so
also
it
is
the
first
duty
of
every
one
to
love
the
land
of
his
birth
patriotism
is
of
two
kinds
the
first
is
a
healthy
one
and
should
be
encouraged
while
the
second
one
is
of
an
undesirable
kind
and
should
be
condemned
we
must
not
have
the
perverted
notion
of
patriotism
that
believes
in
the
dictum

my
country
right
or
wrong
most
of
the
crimes
against
humanity
have
been
committed
by
people
having
this
type
of
fanatic
patriotism
one
should
never
forget
ones
duty
towards
humanity
in
general
the
feeling
of
patriotism
is
important
for
the
freedom
of
a
country
this
feeling
for
their
country
is
called
patriotism
patriotism
is
one
of
the
best
virtues
of
men
a
selfish
man
may
be
rich
he
may
he
born
a
noble
family
he
may
have
a
big
title
but
nobody
respects
him
its
like
a
disease
that
every
man
carries
there
is
no
cure
for
such
a
disease
for
this
is
one
of
pure
determination
and
pride
patriotism
is
what
gave
george
washington
the
courage
to
fight
the
super
power
of
the
world
and
take
charge
of
an
unstable
colony
patriotism
is
why
america
leads
the
world
this
disease
is
why
neil
armstrong
stepped
onto
uncertain
ground
in
the
second
world
war
there
was
a
shortage
of
workers
needed
to
fulfill
the
cry
for
war
supplies
patriotism
may
be
a
disease
but
it
is
one
no
man
should
have
any
intention
of
curing
it
brings
out
compassion
courage
work
ethics
and
bravery
in
us
all
it
is
the
virtue
which
makes
man
does
anything
for
his
native
country
such
people
are
very
dangerous
to
the
country
than
the
real
enemies
the
real
strength
and
power
of
the
country
lies
in
these
patriots
the
patriots
play
prominent
role
in
the
progress
of
a
country
a
person
having
such
attitude
begins
to
look
down
upon
other
countries
it
narrows
down
the
outlook
which
ultimately
proves
disastrous
for
his
personality
development
aggressive
patriotism
sometimes
put
the
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
country
at
danger
mass
killing
of
jews
in
germany
during
the
regime
of
hitler
is
an
example
of
frantic
patriotism
instead
of
being
just
a
love
of
ones
country
these
people
believe
that
the
patriotic
individual
is
blinded
by
what
the
government
is
telling
us
people
that
dont
believe
in
patriotism
also
believe
that
to
be
patriotic
requires
allegiance
to
the
flag
which
means
obedience
and
readiness
to
kill
father
mother
brother
and
sister
just
because
my
family
has
a
huge
american
flag
flying
high
in
the
front
yard
24
hours
a
day
seven
days
a
week
all
year
long
with
a
spot
light
on
it
doesnt
mean
we
have
the
obedience
and
readiness
to
kill
father
mother
brother
and
sister
this
love
for
his
birthplace
grows
into
patriotism
if
his
motherland
is
attacked
by
the
enemies
he
does
not
hesitate
to
fight
for
the
protection
of
freedom
of
his
native
land
this
is
true
patriotism
he
will
serve
the
poor
and
the
distressed
people
of
his
country
out
of
compassion
that
arises
from
patriotism
he
does
not
bother
about
his
personal
interests
or
gains
when
he
goes
forward
with
his
spirit
of
patriotism
patriot
has
at
the
very
least
a
sense
of
pride
in
hisher
nation
wishes
for
its
good
a
sanskrit
saying
runs

mother
and
motherland
dearer
than
heaven
a
patriot
lives
and
dies
for
the
nation
instead
of
being
fascinated
by
attractive
jobs
abroad
heshe
tries
to
find
some
useful
job
at
home
a
patriot
tries

to
contribute
in
all
possible
ways
to
heighten
the
glory
greatness
of
the
nation
heshe
knows
the
value
of
the
of
the
nations
natural
and
cultural
resources
and
contributes
to
their
proper
utilization
and
conservation
in
addition
patriotism
is
also
an
attempt
to
be
independent
and
selfreliant
heshe
protects
the
tradition
culture
norms
and
values
but
is
ready
to
avoid
their
superstitious
and
evil
traits
it
is
one
of
the
noblest
passions
of
human
nature
the
love
of
country
is
natural
and
essential
for
every
one
the
man
who
works
against
the
interest
of
his
country
is
traitor
and
he
does
not
deserve
any
sympathy
the
real
love
urges
man
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
for
the
welfare
of
his
country
patriotism
makes
him
a
good
citizen
who
is
always
ready
to
serve
his
nation
with
best
of
his
talents
patriotism
is
a
sacred
passion
which
makes
the
nation
really
strong
and
honorable
the
great
wars
of
the
world
were
won
only
because
of
the
extreme
sense
of
patriotism
only
those
nations
in
the
world
survive
and
distinguish
themselves
whose
citizens
keep
a
high
and
a
very
positive
sense
of
patriotism
